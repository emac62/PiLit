                        <p>Ellen began her career in 1986, as a full-time Mathematics teacher at Newtonbrook Secondary
                            School in Toronto, Ontario. At that time, there was a surplus of teachers in Toronto and
                            after 2 years she was placed at George S. Henry Academy where she taught various sections of
                            Math, Science, Co-op, Guidance and Physical Education. With 25 years experience she decided
                            it was time to return to her roots - full-time mathematics. For the remainder of her career,
                            Ellen enjoyed the challenge of the Mathematics classroom and continued to improve her
                            teaching practice by completing online courses with Stanford University and working on the
                            Ministry of Education's Renewed Math Strategy program. Ellen retired from the Toronto
                            District School Board in 2018 and is currently learning computer programming at home. </p>

                        <p>Roberta worked as a high school English teacher for over twenty years in the Toronto District
                            School Board. She was the Head of English, ESL and Moderns for the last part of her career
                            and is now ready to share her discoveries one-on-one. She also taught Dramatic Arts,
                            Humanities and Guidance courses and worked for three years as the Head of Student Success
                            including delivering Credit Recovery classes. As a result of Roberta's hard work, the EQAO
                            scores in her school improved by 9% over the last eighteen months. She retired in June of
                            2019 and is looking forward to working towards becoming a professional photographer.</p>
